iii is an artist run, community platform supporting new interdisciplinary practices 
linking performance, technology and the human senses. Arising from the ArtScience 
tradition of The Hague, iii strives to balance technological innovation, theoretical 
reflection and human experience. iii contributes to international developments in the 
field of Art, Science & Technology, functioning both as a cultural incubator supporting 
research and creation, and as an agency connecting creators to a broad audience via a 
wide (inter)national partner network.<br /><br />

<u>iii’s mission is to</u><br />

Inspire people to develop their own ways of engaging with Art, Science & Technology.<br />
Share beautiful and unique experiences connecting technology and the senses.<br />
Discover new forms of physicality, sociality and community in a post-digital world.<br />
Encourage community building, participation and social entrepreneurship across 
disciplinary, geographical and cultural boundaries.<br />
<br />
<u>Core values on which iii’s program is based</u><br />
International Excellence, iii promotes research and creation in the field of Art, 
Science & Technology at the highest international level.<br />
Talent Development, iii offers a platform where the most dedicated new talents can 
jump-start their professional art practice.<br />
Cultural Diversity, iii promotes participation from people with all backgrounds in the 
processes of innovation.<br />
Fair Pay, iii provides work that is creatively and financially rewarding, while also 
advocating on behalf of financially vulnerable groups.<br />
<br />
<u>Artistic Focus</u><br />
iii promotes artistic work that channels the human inclination for curiosity and 
invention and which engages directly with the human senses and the human body.<br />
iii develops projects that present playful approaches to science and technology within 
the fields of music, visual art and theatre. While the field of Art and Technology 
emerged in the 20th century to promote collaboration between specialists working in 
separate disciplines, today we see practices that are interdisciplinary at the root. 
No longer engineers working with artists, artists working with scientists, painters 
working with musicians, but creatives and researchers that navigate between and 
connect formerly distinct realms.<br /><br />

The interdisciplinary focus of iii stems directly from the teachings of Dick Raaymakers 
and Frans Evers at the ArtScience Interfaculty in The Hague. The school is characterised 
both by framing art as a vehicle for human curiosity, as well as for a creative method 
balancing technical innovations with conceptual thinking and sensory experience.
