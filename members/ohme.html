            Ohme is a research and curatorial platform investigating contemporary societal issues through transdisciplinary 
            initiatives in arts and sciences.<br /><br />

            We aim at contributing to the development of a more informed, curious, and inspired society by initiating and 
            facilitating encounters between artists, scientists, students and the general public.<br /><br />

            Our approach is resolutely exploratory, crossing borders between disciplines and ways of knowing, and it translates 
            in a range of activities developed collaboratively.<br /><br />

            Our initiatives traverse artistic forms and scientific disciplines, weaving together visual, sound and performative 
            arts with formal, natural, applied, social and human sciences.<br /><br />

            We have our own engineering lab, dedicated to design, prototype and manufacture. We provide conception, realisation 
            and technical support services to artists, designers, researchers and creative industries.<br /><br />

            Yearly, we offer technical and curatorial support to Belgian and international artists within our residencies programme.<br /><br />

            Ohme forges strong collaborations with research institutions, festivals and art spaces, working and thinking together to push the 
            boundaries of artistic expression and reach a wider public. We curate and produce events and exhibitions.<br /><br />

            Alongside our artistic work, we collaborate with universities, art schools and higher education institutions to develop innovative 
            interdisciplinary academic programmes for scientists and students. We continue to explore transversal approaches that facilitate and
             encourage teachers, learners and researchers to help decompartmentalise mindsets and disciplines, together.<br /><br />
